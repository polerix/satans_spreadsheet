# SATAN'S SPREADSHEETS V6.6.6

**Welcome to the abyss of data entry.**

Satan's Spreadsheets is a cursed, high-stakes spreadsheet application designed for the management of damned souls. It features a unique "handshake" mechanic, alchemical visual effects, and a demotivational interface.

## 666 Features

### 1. The Handshake Protocol (CORE MECHANIC)
**"Maintain the connection, or loose your soul...'s data."**

- **The Mechanic**: The connection to the infernal mainframe is unstable. You must periodically press `[SPACE]` to maintain the "Handshake".
- **Visuals**: A "Carrier" signal strength is displayed. If it drops to 0%, the connection is lost (`NO CARRIER`).
- **Consequence**: Data entry and rendering operations will PAUSE until you re-establish the connection by mashing `[SPACE]`.

### 2. Cursed Glyph Engine (`curse()`)
Text in the application is processed through a distortion engine that adds combining diacritical marks (Zalgo text) to create a "glitched" or "cursed" visual effect.
- **Function**: `curse(text, intensity)`
- **Usage**: Applied to names, statuses, and UI elements like the title to unsettle the user.

### 3. Audio-Visual Feedback
- **Sound**: A generative typing sound engine using the Web Audio API (`AudioContext`). It creates distinct, uncomfortable beeps and clicks for every character rendered.
- **Visuals**:
    - **CRT Monitor Effect**: Scanlines, jitter, and screen glow to simulate an ancient, possessed terminal.
    - **Alchemy Sigils**: Pressing `[SPACE]` summons fleeting alchemical symbols that fly towards the screen.

### 4. CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Damnation)
- **Read**: The `slowRender()` function asynchronously renders row by row, character by character, simulating a slow baud-rate connection.
- **Create**: Press `[A]` to open the modal and condemn a new soul to the list.
- **Update (Bribe)**: Press `[B]` to "bribe" the devil. This moves the selected soul to the top and marks them as `VIP` (Very Important Prisoner).
- **Search**: Press `[S]` to filter the list of the damned.

### 5. Demotivational System
- The application periodically interrupts your workflow with a "MANDATORY REFLECTION" modal.
- Displays despair-inducing quotes.
- You must press `[X]` to accept your fate and continue working.

## Technical Specifications
- **Stack**: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+).
- **No Dependencies**: Runs on pure malice and standard browser APIs.
- **Files**:
    - `index.html`: The skeleton of the beast.
    - `style.css`: The skin (visual styling).
    - `satan.js`: The brain (logic and suffering).

## Installation

2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
